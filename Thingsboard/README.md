    ```
    Run deploy_single.sh

3. Create a device and create an access token for the device.

4. Import the rule chain file: root_rule_chain.json.

4. Configure push_img.conf.

   - Fill in the access token generated by the thingsboard platform host and device under `[thingsboard]`

5. Run the script push_img.py on the device side.
