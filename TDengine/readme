This project manages VM through Vagrant, creates TDengine master nodes using Ansible, and adds nodes to the cluster.
Prepare:
Configure the TDengine template file resources/configuration/tempdelete.conf, and add the TDengine configuration items that need to be changed to the file (such as whether to turn on monitoring, the fqdn of the monitoring cluster, listening ports, etc.). Ansible will be replaced in the TDengine configuration file during deployment. For TDengine configuration parameters, please refer to: https://docs.taosdata.com/reference/config

Start virtual machine:
Vagrant up

Create a cluster (on the master node):
1. unzip ansible.zip
2. ansible-playbook deploy_master.yaml

Join the remote node to the cluster (on the master node):
ansible-playbook add_nodes.yaml

Collect local performance and write it to TDengine:
1. Create a data table: scripts/collect_performance/create_table.py
2. Collect data and write it every 3 seconds to: scripts/collect_performance/collecting.py
